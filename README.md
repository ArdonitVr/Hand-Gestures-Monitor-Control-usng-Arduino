# Hand-Gestures-Monitor-Control-usng-Arduino
Instead of using a keyboard, mouse or any controller, we can use our hand gestures to control some functions of a computer like play/pause a video, move left/right in a photo slideshow, scroll up/down on a website and more. In this project, we have implemented a simple hand gesture control based on Arduino where several functions of your web browser can be controlled such as switching between tabs, scrolling up and down web pages, playing or pausing a video and increase or decrease the volume (in VLC Player) with the help of hand gestures.
